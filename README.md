# Basic Python Assignments Repository

Welcome to the Basic Python Assignments repository! This collection is designed for beginners to learn and practice fundamental concepts in Python programming. Each assignment is implemented in a separate Python file, providing a hands-on approach to learning.

## Topics Covered

1. **Data Types and Variables**
   - *Description*: Learn about basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, and how to use variables to store and manipulate data.
   - *Files*: `basic_datatype.py`

2. **Control Flow (if, elif, else) and Looping**
   - *Description*: Understand conditional statements (if, elif, else) and looping structures (for, while) to control the flow of your Python programs.
   - *Files*: `if_elif_looping.py`

3. **Lists and List Comprehensions**
   - *Description*: Explore lists, a versatile data structure in Python, and learn about list comprehensions for concise and expressive list creation.
   - *Files*: `list_assignments.py`, `list_comprehension_assignment.py`

4. **Dictionaries and Sets**
   - *Description*: Introduction to dictionaries and sets, allowing you to store data in key-value pairs and create unique collections, respectively.
   - *Files*: `dic_assignment.py`

5. **Functions and Modules**
   - *Description*: Define functions and organize code into reusable modules, promoting code modularity and readability.
   - *Files*: `functionsession3.py`

6. **File Handling**
   - *Description*: Learn to read from and write to files, gaining essential skills in handling external data.
   - *Files*: `file_handling.py`

7. **Exception Handling**
   - *Description*: Understand how to handle errors gracefully using try, except blocks to ensure more robust and fault-tolerant programs.
   - *Files*: `exception_handling.py`

8. **Basic Data Structures**
   - *Description*: Introduction to fundamental data structures in Python such as stacks, queues, and tuples.
   - *Files*: `datastructure_comprehension.py`

9. **String Manipulation**
   - *Description*: Explore various string operations and functions for effective text processing.
   - *Files*: `String_function.py`

10. **Basic NumPy Operations**
